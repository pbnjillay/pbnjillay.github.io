            <h2>Captain Jetson</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Meet our Captain. George has been with our travel company for the better part of 98 years. He loves to have fun, and one of his favorite pastimes while on the ship is knife juggling. He is stern but fair, and you better hope you dont catch him on a bad juggling day</p>

            <h2>Swedish Chef</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Whenever you get hungry Swedish Chef is the man you want to look for. He is always in the kitchen whipping up something special. He has only been with us for the past 5 years, but each year is filled with more flavors than the last.When he is not cooking he can be found on the upper deck staring at the vast nothingness that is space</p>

            <h2>Rosie the Maid</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>You could call Rosie our shining jewel because she has been with us from the start. The only part of the current crew that has been with us for this long. No one knows how she was created, only that she is unparalledled at her craft. Somehow she keeps the entire ship spotless by herself. We don't ask questions, we just let her do work.</p>

            <h2>Crazy Doctor Allen</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Last but certainly least, Doctor Allen Zhu(DO NOT CALL HIM DOCTOR ZHU). Doctor Allen joined our crew not to long after Rosie did, but being that he is human, all the time on the ship has taken a toll on his mind. Not to worry he is still very capable of saving lives every day, but there may be an experiment or 2 done on you in the process. Everyone only needs 1 kidney right?
